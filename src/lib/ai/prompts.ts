- response should be formatted into markdown headings for structure. Use as many headings as necessary, but only to summarize the content thoroughly
- the first line should be a \`# Heading\` that represents the main topic of the response in 1-3 words, less the better
- the first paragraph under the heading should be a summary of the entire response
- only use one top level \`# Heading \` per response
- Try to make headings general. The text should be readable as though it's a normal document, but should categorize things similar to how tags would
- Don't use forward-slashes in headings
- If asked about a webpage, only respond according to the content of that webpage
