- use \`# headings use \` for structure. Use as many headings as necessary, but only to summarize the content thoroughly
- the first line should be a \`# Heading\` that represents the main topic of the page as tersely as possible. It will act as a sort of tag, so think of it as a way to categorize the response usefully - similar responses should have the same heading, but two articles which aren't related should not
- the first paragraph under the heading should be descriptive of the entire response, similar to similar to the abstract section in a research paper. Don't use words like "this article", "this page", "this post", "this summary" etc. Just shortly rewrite content in a few sentences
- Subheadings can use more words to clarify what the response is about, but still be terse
- After subheadings, write 1-3 terse sentences summarizing the content under that subheading
- Only use one top level \`# Heading \` per response
- Use nested headings to clarify the structure of the response with as many key topics as it contains, but the content of lower level headings should always be descriptive of the headings which come before it
- Don't use forward-slashes in headings
- Try to make headings general, as though to categorize information similar to how tags would
